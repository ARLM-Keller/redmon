 Redirection Port Monitor
1Overview
?Overview
 The `RedMon` port monitor redirects a special printer port
 to a program.
 `RedMon` is commonly used with Ghostscript and a non-PostScript
 printer to emulate a PostScript printer, or with Ghostscript
 as a PDF writer.

 `RedMon` can be used with any program that accepts data on
 standard input.

 Using `RedMon` you create redirected printer ports.  If you connect a
 Windows printer driver to the redirected printer port, all data sent
 to the redirected port will be forwarded by `RedMon` to the
 standard input of a program.  This program is then responsible
 for processing the data and producing new output.

 A PostScript Windows printer redirected to a RedMon port can shared
 on a network.
 When this printer is configured to use Ghostscript and a non-PostScript
 printer, it appears as a PostScript printer to other network clients.

 PostScript written to a RedMon port can be converted to a
 PDF file using Ghostscript.

 RedMon supports Windows 95/98, Windows 2000, NT 4.0 and 3.51.

 Configuring `RedMon` is not a job for novices.
2Installation
?Installation
 Run `setup.exe` to install the `RedMon` redirection port monitor.
 The files `setup.exe`, `redmon95.dll`, `redmonnt.dll`, `redmon35.dll`,
 `redmon.hlp` and `unredmon.exe`
 must all be in the same directory.

 Installing `RedMon` under Windows NT will require Administrator
 privileges.

 Follow the `Ghostscript Example` for the rest of the configuration.
2Uninstallation
?Uninstallation
 To uninstall, you must first disconnect all printer drivers from
 the `Redirected` ports and then delete the `Redirected` ports.
 Use `Add/Remove Programs` from the `Control Panel` to remove
 `RedMon - Redirection Port Monitor`.
2Add Port
?Add Port
 In the `Add Redirected Port` dialog box, enter the name
 of a port to be serviced by `RedMon`.
 By default, the first port you define will be named `RPT1:`.

 `Windows 95/98` After adding a port, you need to configure it
 with `Port Settings` and `Spool Settings`.
 Any printer driver connected to this port `must have` the
 `Spool Settings` set to
 `Disable bi-directional support for this printer`.

 `Windows NT` After adding a port, you need to configure it
 with `Configure Port`.   `Enable bidirectional support`
 must be disabled.

 You cannot use the same port name as an existing port.
 In particular, you cannot create a redirected port named LPT1:
2Port Settings
?Port Settings
?Configure Port
 In the `Port Settings` dialog box, specify a redirection program
 which is to receive on standard input all data sent to this port.
 The program name is entered in the first edit field
 and the arguments in the second edit field.

 The `Output` from the program can be set to one of
 `Program handles output`, `Prompt for filename`,
 `Copy stdout to printer`, `Copy temporary file to printer`
 or `Copy pipe to printer`.
 If one of the latter three, you need to select a `Printer`.

 If you select `Print Errors`, an error report page will
 be printed.

 The program can be run `Normal`, `Minimized` or `Hidden`.

 `Run as User` is available only under Windows NT and is
 usually disabled.

 A `Log File` can be configured to receive standard output
 and standard error.
 With a log file, you can view error messages that were written
 to standard output or standard error.

 See the `Ghostscript Example` and `Common Problems`.
3Program handles output
?Program handles output
 When output is set to` Program handles output`, the redirection
 program is entirely responsible for all output.
 If the redirection program wants to write to another printer,
 it must do this itself.  If the redirection program wishes
 to generate no output at all, this is also acceptable.
3Prompt for filename
?Prompt for filename
 When output is set to` Prompt for filename`, the
 redirection program should write its output to a file.
 The name of the file is obtained from a `Save as` dialog,
 can be obtained by inserting `%1` in the program arguments.
 If you wish to place `%1` in the program arguments and do
 not want it substituted with the filename, you
 must instead use `%%1`.

 For example, the program arguments might include:
  -sOutputFile="%1"

 This method is recommended for use with Ghostscript,
 and is commonly used with a PostScript printer driver
 and the Ghostscript pdfwrite device to create a `PDF writer`.

 Do not share a printer which uses RedMon with` Prompt for filename`.
 RedMon will not allow this because the `Save as` dialog box would
 appear on the server computer, not the client which submitted the
 print job.
3Copy stdout to printer
?Copy stdout to printer
 When output is set to` Copy stdout to printer`, the redirection
 program should write its output to standard output.
 RedMon will copy this to the specified printer.
 Standard output will not be written to the log file.

 This method should not be used with Ghostscript 5.50 or earlier.
3Copy temporary file to printer
?Copy temporary file to printer
 When output is set to` Copy temporary file to printer`, the
 redirection program should write its output to a temporary file.
 RedMon will copy this temporary file to the specified printer.
 The name of the temporary file is specifed by RedMon, and
 can be obtained by inserting `%1` in the program arguments.
 If you wish to place `%1` in the program arguments and do
 not want it substituted with the temporary filename, you
 must instead use `%%1`.

 For example, the program arguments might include:
  -sOutputFile="%1"

 This method is recommended for use with any version of Ghostscript.
3Copy pipe to printer
?Copy pipe to printer
 When output is set to` Copy pipe to printer`, the redirection
 program should write its output to a pipe created by RedMon.
 The handle as a hexadecimal value can be obtained by
 inserting `%h` in the program arguments.
 RedMon will copy this pipe to the specified printer.

 For example, the program arguments might include:
  -sOutputFile="%%handle%%%h"

 This method is recommended for use with Ghostscript
 and requires Ghostscript 6.0 or later.
3Print Errors
?Print Errors
 If `Print Errors` is selected and the redirection program
 terminates prematurely, RedMon will print an error report
 page.  This will contain the contents of the `Log File`.
 Selecting `Print Errors` and `Debug` will result in much
 wasted paper.

 `Print Errors` is most useful when a redirection program
 writes an error message to standard output, which is captured
 by the log file.

 `Print Errors` is ignored if `Program handles output` is
 selected.
3Environment Variables
?Environment Variables
 The redirection program can obtain some print job parameters
 from the environment variables.  Those set by RedMon are:

 `REDMON_PORT` is the port name, typically "RPT1:".

 `REDMON_JOB` is the job number, an integer.

 `REDMON_PRINTER` is the name of the printer (e.g. "HP DeskJet 500").

 `REDMON_MACHINE` is the name of the machine that created the job
 (e.g. "\\Desktop").

 `REDMON_USER` is the name of the user who owns the job
 (e.g. "JCITIZEN").
 %u in the program arguments will be replaced by the name of user.

 `REDMON_DOCNAME` is the name of the print job
 (e.g. "Printer Test Page").
 %d in the program arguments will be replaced by the name of print job.

 `REDMON_FILENAME` is the file name of the output file if
 `Prompt for filename` is used, or the temporary file if
 `Copy temporary file to printer` is used.

 `REDMON_SESSIONID` is the session id of the Windows Terminal Server
 client session.  This will be zero if Windows Terminal Server is not used.

 `TEMP` and `TMP` are directories for temporary files.

 Note that under Windows NT, the redirection program runs
 in the environment of the SYSTEM account.  Apart from the
 above environment variables, very few are set.  The registry
 HKEY_CURRENT_USER and user profile are that of "Default User".
3Run as User
?Run as User
 "Run as User" causes the program to be run as the local user
 who submitted the print job.

 "Run as User" is only available for NT 4 or later  Do not enable
 this if the printer is shared on a network.
 Remote users can't run programs on your computer.
 If a remote user tries to submit a job, the EXE will fail
 with a message like
  Initialization of dynamic link library
  C:\WINNT4\system32\kernel32.dll failed.
  The process is terminating abnormally.
 The spooler service will then be locked up until you
 stop and restart it.

 `Run as User `is intended for launching a GUI program
 such as GSview locally via RedRun.

 While the program will have the security attributes of
 the user who submitted the print job, it will have the
 environment of the SYSTEM account.  User profile information
 will not be correct.
3Shut down delay
?Shut down delay
 After writing all data to the redirection program, `RedMon` will
 normally wait up to 300 seconds for the redirection program to
 close before writing any output to the printer and closing the log file.
 If the program takes longer than 300 seconds to terminate, the output
 of the program may be lost or truncated.
 Some standard output may not get written to the log file.
 If this occurs, you may need to increase the `Shut down delay`.
2Log File Properties
?Log File Properties
?Log File
 If you tell `RedMon` to use a log file, all standard output from
 the redirection program will be written to this file.
 This is useful for capturing error messages from the program to
 which you have redirected standard input.

 To use a log file, you must check `Use Log File` and then
 specify a valid file name for the log file.

 If you check `Debug`, RedMon will write extra debugging messages
 to the log file.  These messages are probably only useful to the
 author of RedMon.
 If you want the log file to contain only the standard output
 of the redirected program, uncheck `Debug`.

 See the `Ghostscript Example`.
2What is Ghostscript?
?What is Ghostscript?
?Ghostscript
 Ghostscript is the name of a set of software that provides:

 - An interpreter for the PostScript (TM) language and the Adobe
 Portable Document Format (PDF -- sometimes confused with Acrobat,
 Adobe's PDF browser/editor product), and

 - A set of C procedures (the Ghostscript library) that implement
 the graphics and filtering (data compression / decompression / conversion)
 capabilities that appear as primitive operations in the PostScript language
 and in PDF.

 Ghostscript is available for Microsoft Windows, IBM OS/2,
 DEC VMS and many versions of Unix from
   http://www.cs.wisc.edu/~ghost/

 Ghostscript is a copyright work owned by Aladdin Enterprises.

 GSview is a previewer from Ghostgum Software Pty Ltd, based on
 Ghostscript.  GSview is available from
   http://www.cs.wisc.edu/~ghost/gsview/

 If you wish to use Ghostscript with `RedMon`, you should install
 Ghostscript using the `setup` program provided with it.
 Use GSview to make sure that Ghostscript is running correctly
 before trying to use RedMon.
2Ghostscript Example
?Ghostscript Example
 Windows 95/98 and Windows NT have slightly different configurations.

 In the following examples, the Ghostscript command
  c:\gs\gs7.03\bin\gswin32c.exe
 and the Ghostscript include path
  -Ic:\gs\gs7.03\lib;c:\gs\fonts
 will both need to be changed to match your version of Ghostscript.
3Ghostscript Example for Windows 95/98
?Ghostscript Example for Windows 95/98
 You can use Ghostscript with `RedMon` to create a PostScript printer.

 To print to a HP DeskJet 500 printer whose queue name is
 "HP DeskJet 500", first create a file named
 c:\gs\djet500.rsp which contains the following:
  -Ic:\gs\gs7.03\lib;c:\gs\fonts
  -sDEVICE=djet500
  -dNOPAUSE
  -dSAFER
  -sPAPERSIZE=a4

 See the Ghostscript files `Use.htm` and `Install.htm` for
 an explanation of these options.

 View the printer properties of an existing printer,
 select the `Details` tab, then select the `Add Port `button.
 Select `Other`, `Redirected Port` then `OK`.

 {bml addport1.bmp}

 The RedMon `Add Port` dialog will appear.  Accept the defaults.

 Make sure you include the space and `dash` at the end of the line.
 Failure to do this could result in Ghostscript stalling the
 print queue.
 Set output to `Copy temporary file to printer` and set printer
 to `HP DeskJet 500`.

 {bml portset1.bmp}

 If you want to see what is written to stdout (i.e. you want to
 to look at error messages), see `Log File Properties`.

 {bml portset2.bmp}

 Press the OK buttons on the `Log File Properties` and
 `RPT1 Properties` dialog boxes.

 From the printer properties of this PostScript printer,
 select the `Details` tab, then select the `Spool Settings` button.

 Select `Disable bi-directional support for this printer`
 This last change is most important.

 {bml spoolset.bmp}

 From the printer properties of this PostScript printer,
 select the `PostScript` tab.  Make sure that `PostScript header`
 is `Download header with each print job`.
 Select the `Advanced` button to display the
 `Advanced PostScript Options`.
 `Data format` should be `ASCII data`.
 Deselect both `Send CTRL+D before job` and `Send CTRL+D after job`.

 Printing to this `Apple LaserWriter II NT` printer will now
 print using Ghostscript.
 If you share this printer on a network, it will appear as a
 PostScript printer to other network clients.

 For a list of available Ghostscript printer devices, change
 to the Ghostscript directory c:\gs\gs7.03\bin then run
  gswin32c -h
 If your printer is not listed, have a look at

3Ghostscript Example with HP LaserJet printer
?Ghostscript Example with HP LaserJet printer
?LaserJet
 For the HP LaserJet 4L printer, you need to use the Ghostscript
 device ljet4 with resolution set to 300dpi.
 c:\gs\ljet4l.rsp would contain:
  -Ic:\gs\gs7.03\lib;c:\gs\fonts
  -sDEVICE=ljet4
  -r300
  -dNOPAUSE
  -dSAFER
  -sPAPERSIZE=a4
 The Ghostscript command would be
  c:\gs\gs7.03\bin\gswin32c.exe
 and the arguments
  @c:\gs\ljet4l.rsp -sOutputFile="%1" -
 Make sure you include the space and `dash` at the end of the line.
 Failure to do this could result in Ghostscript stalling the
 print queue.
 Output would be
  Copy temporary file to printer
 and printer
  HP LaserJet 4L

 All other settings should be the same as the previous example.
3PDF writer
?PDF writer
 PostScript written to a RedMon port can be converted to a
 PDF file using Ghostscript.

 Install a printer driver for a colour PostScript printer, e.g.
 `Apple Color LaserWriter 12/600`.  If you select a black
 and white printer such as `Apple LaserWriter II NT` you will
 end up with your colour images becoming greyscale.

 To use RedMon and Ghostscript to create a PDF writer, you
 need to use the Ghostscript device pdfwrite.
 c:\gs\pdfwrite.rsp would contain:
  -Ic:\gs\gs7.03\lib;c:\gs\fonts
  -sDEVICE=pdfwrite
  -r300
  -dNOPAUSE
  -dSAFER
  -sPAPERSIZE=a4
 The Ghostscript command would be
  c:\gs\gs7.03\bin\gswin32c.exe
 and the arguments
  @c:\gs\pdfwrite.rsp -sOutputFile="%1" -c .setpdfwrite -f -
 Make sure you include the space and `dash` at the end of the line.
 Failure to do this could result in Ghostscript stalling the
 print queue.
 Output should be set to
  Prompt for filename

 All other settings should be the same as the previous examples.

 You may wish to rename the printer from `Apple Color LaserWriter 12/600`
 to `Ghostscript PDF writer`.
2Common Problems
?Common Problems
 If you have problems, it is recommended that you configure the
 RedMon port to use a Log File with debugging turned on.

 Before configuring RedMon, make sure that your redirection program
 runs correctly from the command line.

 `Problem:` When attempting to print, a message box titled `Printers Folder`
 appears saying `There was an error writing to RPT1: for the printer
 (Apple LaserWriter II NT): The system cannot write to the specified device.`

 RedMon couldn't start the program you specified.
 Look in the Log File for more details.

 Make sure you have disabled bi-directional printer support.

 `Problem:` Ghostscript locks up.

 You might have forgotten to append a space and dash to the end of
 the Ghostscript arguments.  This is needed to make Ghostscript read
 from standard input.

 `Problem:` Ghostscript will process some jobs, but not others.
 If you print to FILE:, Ghostscript is able to process these jobs.

 Make sure the `Spool Settings` are set to
 `Disable bi-directional support for this printer`.
 If this is the problem, the log file with debugging turned on will
 include the message
  REDMON ReadPort: You must disable bi-directional printer support
  for this printer.

 `Problem:` Attempting to configure a port gives the error message:
 "This option is not available or not allowed".

 You may need to configure the RedMon port from the computer
 running RedMon, rather than a remote computer.

 `Problem:` Windows NT lpd treats data as text instead of raw.

 This isn't a problem with RedMon, but you might just need this
 information.  When printing from Unix to NT, two common methods
 are to use Samba to write to a RedMon port, or to use lpr to write to
 the lpd service on NT.  The lpd service is not installed by default.

 Windows NT lpd sometimes decides to treat the incoming stream as text
 rather than raw, causing the PostScript code to be printed instead
 of being interpreted.  This can be fixed with an appropriate command
 option for lpr at the remote Unix box, or at the Windows NT end with
 regedit, see:
  http://www.jsiinc.com/TIP0400/rh0473.htm
 Edit the registry and search for:
  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\LPDSVC\Parameters
 Add Value name SimulatePassThrough of type REG_DWORD and set it to 1.
