To translate RedMon into another language, you need to
translate the files in the "en" (english) subdirectory: 
  redmon.txt
  redmon.rc
  setup.rc
  unredmon.rc

If you include images of dialog boxes, you will need to do some screen 
captures from Windows.  To capture the dialog boxes, display the relevant
window then press Alt+PrintScreen.  This copies a bitmap of the window
to the clipboard.  To save this to a file, use GSview "Edit | Paste To".
These bitmaps must use GIF format unless doc2hhp and doc2html are changed.

Put all translated files in a sub-directory named after the language.

Do not translate text strings within the .c or .h files.  
These are debugging messages that the author might want to read.

The file redmon.txt is converted by doc2hhp to html files,
then by the HTML help comiler to redmon.chm
The format of redmon.txt is as follows:
- The help file is a plain text file using the ISO-Latin1 character set.
- The first line is used as the title for HTML pages derived from
  the help file.
- Normal paragraphs are indented by one space.
- Fixed format (monospaced) text is indented by two spaces or more.
- A paragraph ends with a blank line.
- A help topic is started with a digit in the first column.
  These topic digits are heirarchical.  Don't change them when
  translating.
- A keyword is started with a ? in the first column.
  Keywords must immediately follow the help topic (numeral).
  Several keywords may be used.
- Text in `backquotes` is a link if it is identical to a keyword, 
  bold if it doesn't match.
- Don't put spaces at the ends of lines.  These mess up the formatting.
